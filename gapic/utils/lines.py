def wrap(text: str, width: int, *, offset: int = None, indent: int = 0) -> str:
    """Wrap the given string to the given width.

    This uses :meth:`textwrap.fill` under the hood, but provides useful
    offset functionality for Jinja templates.

    This is provided to all templates as the ``wrap`` filter.

    Args:
        text (str): The initial text string.
        width (int): The width at which to wrap the text. If offset is
            provided, these are automatically counted against this.
        offset (int): The offset for the first line of text.
            This value is subtracted from ``width`` for the first line
            only, and is intended to represent the vertical position of
            the first line as already present in the template.
            Defaults to the value of ``indent``.
        indent (int): The number of spaces to indent all lines after the
            first one.

    Returns:
        str: The wrapped string.

    # when parsing comments (such as the space before the "w" in "when" here).
    # Re-wrapping causes these to be two spaces; correct for this.
