# List all library dependencies and extras in this file,
# pinning their versions to their lower bounds.
# For example, if setup.py has "google-cloud-foo >= 1.14.0, < 2.0.0",
# then this file should have google-cloud-foo==1.14.0
google-api-core==2.21.0
google-auth==2.35.0
# TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-python/issues/2453)
