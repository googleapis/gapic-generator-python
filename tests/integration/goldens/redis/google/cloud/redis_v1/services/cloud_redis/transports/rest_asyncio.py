    Configures and manages Cloud Memorystore for Redis instances

    Google Cloud Memorystore for Redis v1

    The ``redis.googleapis.com`` service implements the Google Cloud
    Memorystore for Redis API and defines the following resource model
    for managing Redis instances:

    -  The service works with a collection of cloud projects, named:
       ``/projects/*``
    -  Each project has a collection of available locations, named:
       ``/locations/*``
    -  Each location has a collection of Redis instances, named:
       ``/instances/*``
    -  As such, Redis instances are resources of the form:
       ``/projects/{project_id}/locations/{location_id}/instances/{instance_id}``

    Note that location_id must be referring to a GCP ``region``; for
    example:

    -  ``projects/redpepper-1290/locations/us-central1/instances/my-redis``

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1

            url_scheme (str): the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally
