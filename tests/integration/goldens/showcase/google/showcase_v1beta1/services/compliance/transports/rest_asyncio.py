    This service is used to test that GAPICs implement various
    REST-related features correctly. This mostly means transcoding
    proto3 requests to REST format correctly for various types of
    HTTP annotations, but it also includes verifying that unknown
    (numeric) enums received by clients can be round-tripped
    correctly.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends JSON representations of protocol buffers over HTTP/1.1

                Generally, you only need to set this if you are developing
                your own client library.
            url_scheme (str): the protocol scheme for the API endpoint.  Normally
                "https", but for testing or local servers,
                "http" can be specified.
