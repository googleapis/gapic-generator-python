# List all library dependencies and extras in this file.
# Pin the version to the lower bound.
# e.g., if setup.py has "google-cloud-foo >= 1.14.0, < 2.0.0",
# Then this file should have google-cloud-foo==1.14.0
google-api-core==1.34.1
google-auth==2.35.0
# TODO(https://github.com/googleapis/gapic-generator-python/issues/2453)
# Add the minimum supported version of grpcio to constraints files
proto-plus==1.22.3
protobuf==4.25.8
# cryptography is a direct dependency of google-auth
