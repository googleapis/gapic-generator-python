class Trigger(proto.Message):
    r"""A representation of the trigger resource.

    Attributes:
        name (str):
            Required. The resource name of the trigger. Must be unique
            within the location on the project and must be in
            ``projects/{project}/locations/{location}/triggers/{trigger}``
            format.
        uid (str):
            Output only. Server assigned unique
            identifier for the trigger. The value is a UUID4
            string and guaranteed to remain unchanged until
            the resource is deleted.
        create_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The creation time.
        update_time (google.protobuf.timestamp_pb2.Timestamp):
            Output only. The last-modified time.
        event_filters (MutableSequence[google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.EventFilter]):
            Required. null The list of filters that
            applies to event attributes. Only events that
            match all the provided filters will be sent to
            the destination.
        service_account (str):
            Optional. The IAM service account email associated with the
            trigger. The service account represents the identity of the
            trigger.

            The principal who calls this API must have
            ``iam.serviceAccounts.actAs`` permission in the service
            account. See
            https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/understanding-service-accounts?hl=en#sa_common
            for more information.

            For Cloud Run destinations, this service account is used to
            generate identity tokens when invoking the service. See
            https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/pubsub-push#create-service-account
            for information on how to invoke authenticated Cloud Run
            services. In order to create Audit Log triggers, the service
            account should also have ``roles/eventarc.eventReceiver``
            IAM role.
        destination (google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.Destination):
            Required. Destination specifies where the
            events should be sent to.
        transport (google.cloud.eventarc_v1.types.Transport):
            Optional. In order to deliver messages,
            Eventarc may use other GCP products as transport
            intermediary. This field contains a reference to
            that transport intermediary. This information
            can be used for debugging purposes.
        labels (MutableMapping[str, str]):
            Optional. User labels attached to the
            triggers that can be used to group resources.
        etag (str):
            Output only. This checksum is computed by the
            server based on the value of other fields, and
            may be sent only on create requests to ensure
            the client has an up-to-date value before
            proceeding.
