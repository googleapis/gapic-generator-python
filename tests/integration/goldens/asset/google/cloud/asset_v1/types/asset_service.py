class BigQueryDestination(proto.Message):
    r"""A BigQuery destination for exporting assets to.

    Attributes:
        dataset (str):
            Required. The BigQuery dataset in format
            "projects/projectId/datasets/datasetId", to which the
            snapshot result should be exported. If this dataset does not
            exist, the export call returns an INVALID_ARGUMENT error.
        table (str):
            Required. The BigQuery table to which the
            snapshot result should be written. If this table
            does not exist, a new table with the given name
            will be created.
        force (bool):
            If the destination table already exists and this flag is
            ``TRUE``, the table will be overwritten by the contents of
            assets snapshot. If the flag is ``FALSE`` or unset and the
            destination table already exists, the export call returns an
            INVALID_ARGUMEMT error.
        partition_spec (google.cloud.asset_v1.types.PartitionSpec):
            [partition_spec] determines whether to export to partitioned
            table(s) and how to partition the data.

            If [partition_spec] is unset or
            [partition_spec.partition_key] is unset or
            ``PARTITION_KEY_UNSPECIFIED``, the snapshot results will be
            exported to non-partitioned table(s). [force] will decide
            whether to overwrite existing table(s).

            If [partition_spec] is specified. First, the snapshot
            results will be written to partitioned table(s) with two
            additional timestamp columns, readTime and requestTime, one
            of which will be the partition key. Secondly, in the case
            when any destination table already exists, it will first try
            to update existing table's schema as necessary by appending
            additional columns. Then, if [force] is ``TRUE``, the
            corresponding partition will be overwritten by the snapshot
            results (data in different partitions will remain intact);
            if [force] is unset or ``FALSE``, it will append the data.
            An error will be returned if the schema update or data
            appension fails.
        separate_tables_per_asset_type (bool):
            If this flag is ``TRUE``, the snapshot results will be
            written to one or multiple tables, each of which contains
            results of one asset type. The [force] and [partition_spec]
            fields will apply to each of them.

            Field [table] will be concatenated with "*" and the asset
            type names (see
            https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types
            for supported asset types) to construct per-asset-type table
            names, in which all non-alphanumeric characters like "." and
            "/" will be substituted by "*". Example: if field [table] is
            "mytable" and snapshot results contain
            "storage.googleapis.com/Bucket" assets, the corresponding
            table name will be "mytable_storage_googleapis_com_Bucket".
            If any of these tables does not exist, a new table with the
            concatenated name will be created.

            When [content_type] in the ExportAssetsRequest is
            ``RESOURCE``, the schema of each table will include
            RECORD-type columns mapped to the nested fields in the
            Asset.resource.data field of that asset type (up to the 15
            nested level BigQuery supports
            (https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/nested-repeated#limitations)).
            The fields in >15 nested levels will be stored in JSON
            format string as a child column of its parent RECORD column.

            If error occurs when exporting to any table, the whole
            export call will return an error but the export results that
            already succeed will persist. Example: if exporting to
            table_type_A succeeds when exporting to table_type_B fails
            during one export call, the results in table_type_A will
            persist and there will not be partial results persisting in
            a table.

            parameters, must be identical to those in the previous call.
        order_by (str):
            Optional. A comma-separated list of fields specifying the
            sorting order of the results. The default order is
            ascending. Add " DESC" after the field name to indicate

    Attributes:
        scope (str):
            Required. A scope can be a project, a folder, or an
            organization. The search is limited to the IAM policies
            within the ``scope``. The caller must be granted the
            ```cloudasset.assets.searchAllIamPolicies`` <https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/access-control#required_permissions>`__
            permission on the desired scope.

            The allowed values are:

            -  projects/{PROJECT_ID} (e.g., "projects/foo-bar")
            -  projects/{PROJECT_NUMBER} (e.g., "projects/12345678")
            -  folders/{FOLDER_NUMBER} (e.g., "folders/1234567")
            -  organizations/{ORGANIZATION_NUMBER} (e.g.,
               "organizations/123456")
        query (str):
            Optional. The query statement. See `how to construct a
            query <https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/searching-iam-policies#how_to_construct_a_query>`__
            for more information. If not specified or empty, it will
            search all the IAM policies within the specified ``scope``.
            Note that the query string is compared against each Cloud
            IAM policy binding, including its members, roles, and Cloud
            IAM conditions. The returned Cloud IAM policies will only
            contain the bindings that match your query. To learn more
            about the IAM policy structure, see `IAM policy
            doc <https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#structure>`__.

            Examples:

            -  ``policy:amy@gmail.com`` to find IAM policy bindings that
               specify user "amy@gmail.com".
            -  ``policy:roles/compute.admin`` to find IAM policy
               bindings that specify the Compute Admin role.
            -  ``policy:comp*`` to find IAM policy bindings that contain
               "comp" as a prefix of any word in the binding.
            -  ``policy.role.permissions:storage.buckets.update`` to
               find IAM policy bindings that specify a role containing
               "storage.buckets.update" permission. Note that if callers
               don't have ``iam.roles.get`` access to a role's included
               permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will
               be dropped from the search results.
            -  ``policy.role.permissions:upd*`` to find IAM policy
               bindings that specify a role containing "upd" as a prefix
               of any word in the role permission. Note that if callers
               don't have ``iam.roles.get`` access to a role's included
               permissions, policy bindings that specify this role will
               be dropped from the search results.
            -  ``resource:organizations/123456`` to find IAM policy
               bindings that are set on "organizations/123456".
            -  ``resource=//cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com/projects/myproject``
               to find IAM policy bindings that are set on the project
               named "myproject".
            -  ``Important`` to find IAM policy bindings that contain
               "Important" as a word in any of the searchable fields
               (except for the included permissions).
            -  ``resource:(instance1 OR instance2) policy:amy`` to find
               IAM policy bindings that are set on resources "instance1"
               or "instance2" and also specify user "amy".
            -  ``roles:roles/compute.admin`` to find IAM policy bindings
               that specify the Compute Admin role.
            -  ``memberTypes:user`` to find IAM policy bindings that
               contain the "user" member type.
        page_size (int):
            Optional. The page size for search result pagination. Page
            size is capped at 500 even if a larger value is given. If
            set to zero, server will pick an appropriate default.
            Returned results may be fewer than requested. When this
            happens, there could be more results as long as
            ``next_page_token`` is returned.
        page_token (str):
            Optional. If present, retrieve the next batch of results
            from the preceding call to this method. ``page_token`` must
            be the value of ``next_page_token`` from the previous
            response. The values of all other method parameters must be
            identical to those in the previous call.
        asset_types (MutableSequence[str]):
            Optional. A list of asset types that the IAM policies are
            attached to. If empty, it will search the IAM policies that
            are attached to all the `searchable asset
            types <https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types#searchable_asset_types>`__.

            Regular expressions are also supported. For example:

            -  "compute.googleapis.com.*" snapshots IAM policies
               attached to asset type starts with
               "compute.googleapis.com".
            -  ".*Instance" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset
               type ends with "Instance".
            -  ".*Instance.*" snapshots IAM policies attached to asset
               type contains "Instance".

            See `RE2 <https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax>`__ for
            all supported regular expression syntax. If the regular
            expression does not match any supported asset type, an
            INVALID_ARGUMENT error will be returned.
        order_by (str):
            Optional. A comma-separated list of fields specifying the
            sorting order of the results. The default order is
            ascending. Add " DESC" after the field name to indicate
            descending order. Redundant space characters are ignored.
            Example: "assetType DESC, resource". Only singular primitive
            fields in the response are sortable:

            -  resource
            -  assetType
            -  project All the other fields such as repeated fields
               (e.g., ``folders``) and non-primitive fields (e.g.,
