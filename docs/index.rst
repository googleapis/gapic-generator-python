API Client Generator for Python
===============================

    A generator for protocol buffer described APIs for and in Python 3.

This tool is a client library generator that implements the
`client library generators`_ specification.

It accepts an API specified in `protocol buffers`_ and generates
a client library, which can be used to interact with that API. It is
implemented as a plugin to ``protoc``, the protocol buffer compiler.
