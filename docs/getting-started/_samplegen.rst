Generating Samples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In addition to generating client libraries, the generator can also create standalone executable code samples.

The user can specify individual sample config files or can pass paths to directories that contain sample configs. Directories are searched recursively, and any file that is not a sample config is ignored.

 TODO: provide documentation links when they are present

A full description of the sample config, generated manifest, and generated samples is outside the scope of this documentation.
We will provide links to such documentation when it is ready.

Samples and manifests are always generated in a 'samples' subdir of the destination directory.
