If you want to experiment with an already-existing API, one example is
available. (Reminder that this is still considered experimental, so apologies
for this part being a bit strange.)

You need to clone the `googleapis`_ repository from GitHub:

.. code-block:: shell

  $ git clone https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis.git

It is possible to generate libraries for most (possibly all) APIs described
here. The API we use as an example is the `Google Cloud Vision`_ API,
available in the ``google/cloud/vision/v1/`` subdirectory. This will be used
for the remainder of the examples on this page.

.. _googleapis: https://github.com/googleapis/googleapis
.. _Google Cloud Vision: https://cloud.google.com/vision/
