    This service is used showcase the four main types of rpcs -
    unary, server side streaming, client side streaming, and
    bidirectional streaming. This service also exposes methods that
    explicitly implement server delay, and paginated calls. Set the
    'showcase-trailer' metadata key on any method to have the values
    echoed in the response trailers. Set the 'x-goog-request-params'
    metadata key on any method to have the values echoed in the
    response headers.

    This class defines the same methods as the primary client, so the
    primary client can load the underlying transport implementation
    and call it.

    It sends protocol buffers over the wire using gRPC (which is built on
    top of HTTP/2); the ``grpcio`` package must be installed.
